Online Shop Management System
<br>
Introduction

My Online Shop Management System is a web-based application built with PHP that helps local shop owners manage their products, categories, billing, and workers efficiently. It provides a modern, responsive interface powered by Tailwind CSS, Font Awesome, and other CDN-based tools for faster loading and cleaner design.

The system is designed to make day-to-day shop operations easier by providing features like product management, category handling, billing history, and worker login/signup.
